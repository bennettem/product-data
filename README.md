# E-commerce Back End Starter Code

This back end application allows a user to create and add to a database in order to compete with other e-commerce companies. The user is able to not only pull the full list of products, catergories, and tags - they are also able to update and delete them with ease. If a user is in need for a specific product or item they are able to look each specific ids within the databases. If a user is need to update a databse with a missing or new product/item they are able to do so by creating a new item. After the user creates a new item they simply have to run the all products, tags, or caterogies and it will appear on the list.
